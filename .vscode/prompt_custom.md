1. After each loop step, the atoms of the top bar are moved in the direction (1, 0.1 * D, 0), where D is the initial distance between the top and bottom bars. 
2. But after this move, the atoms of the bottom bar are fixed. They do not move. Only the other atoms are allowed to move by the springs displacement.

The movie shows that the atoms of the top and bottom bars are moving. Please, fix this issue. I think the problem is related to the file `in.springs_loop`.
